:::{#about-me}
I have experience working in industry as well academic environments. My work in industry primarily dealt with automation. In the academic setting, I have experience working as a teaching assistant wherein I assisted in delivering content to 90+ students.

I am currently working as a teaching assistant and I do all this intending to help people understand concepts and at the same time get more clarity on the AI concepts.

My interest lies in applying AI in helping to understand the human brain and I hope to work towards a cause that could change the lives of millions.
