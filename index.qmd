:::{#about-me}
I currently work as a research assistant at [StellarDNN Lab](https://www.stellardnn.org/). I have experience working in industrial and teaching environments in the past. In my industrial role at Athenahealth, I primarily worked on test automation.
My teaching role was at [Univ.AI](https://www.univ.ai/) where I assisted in developing AI courses.

You can read more about me and my work [here](about.qmd).
